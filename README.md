Simple flask application that takes in the URL to two steam games and then compares them against an adjective
of the user's choosing. This works by getting the game descriptions as context for the model and then having the AI
answer a question based off of that.

This is merely a proof of concept, and rudimentary neural networks should not be used in place of actual decision
making.
